  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a dedicated Surveying and Geomatics Engineering professional with practical experience in GIS, remote sensing, and field operations. My passion lies in spatial data accuracy, modern surveying technologies, and delivering precise, actionable geospatial insights.

Throughout my academic and field journey, I have worked extensively with tools such as ArcGIS, QGIS, AutoCAD, ERDAS Imagine, Global Mapper, and Pix4D, as well as Total Stations, GNSS receivers, and UAV/drone mapping systems. I am skilled in topographic surveying, geodetic computations, data processing, and map creation for various applications including urban planning, infrastructure development, and environmental analysis.

My approach combines technical proficiency with a problem-solving mindset. I take pride in producing reliable spatial datasets and clear visual outputs that support informed decision-making. Staying updated with emerging technologies and continuously improving my skills is central to my professional growth.

Whether working independently or in a team, I am committed to accuracy, innovation, and the responsible use of geospatial data to address real-world challenges.</p>
